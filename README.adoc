BiMap QuadTree
==============
sternenseemann

A BiMap is a Map that does not make use of a Key → Value scheme.

Instead a BiMap allows lookup of both Keys and "Values" (called 'Yek' from now on).

Both operations (lookup of a Key or a Yek) are both as efficient.

== Stability

The API is not complete yet. There may be unfixed bugs.

So do not use it in production yet.

== Building

=== Standard Method

[source,shell]
----
cabal update
(cabal sandbox init)
cabal install --only-dependencies
cabal build

cabal repl # for playing around
----

=== Using Nix

[source, shell]
----
nix-shell
cabal build
cabal repl # for playing around
----

== Documentation

…can be generated using Haddock: `cabal haddock`.

The API aims to be as similar to `Data.Map` as possible.

== TODO

* Functor instance?
* Foldable instance / foldl
* Traversable instance
* Monoid instance
* union(With)
* member / notMember
* delete
* adjust(WithKey)
* keys, assocs
* fromSet
* keysSet
* filter
* difference
* … (rest of the API)
